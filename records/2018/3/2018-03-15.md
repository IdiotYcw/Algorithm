# column <columnName> is of type jsonb but expression is of type text[]
Arrays:

First of all, let's take a close look at this important text from the Postgresql Arrays document.

> Tip: Arrays are not sets; searching for specific array elements can be a sign of database misdesign. Consider using a separate table with a row for each item that would be an array element. This will be easier to search, and is likely to scale better for a large number of elements.

Most of the time, you should not be using arrays.

JSONB:

JSONB is available in Django as the JSONField type. This field is more scalable and flexible than array fields and can be search more efficiently. However if you find yourself searching inside JSONB fields all the time the above statement about Arrys is equally valid for JSONB.

Now what do we have in your system? A an array that holds JSONB field. This is a disaster waiting to happen. Please normalize your data.


无法 `ArrayField(JSONField(blank=True), blank=True)`

可以 `ArrayField(CharField, blank=True)`

即 ArrayField不能表示\[{}, {}]，只能表示\[x, x, x]

而JSONField 既能表示{WTE} 也能表示\[WTE]
