# 前端(VUE)登录成功后，Response header中有set-cookie，但浏览器没有存储cookie
登录的ajax请求需要设置credentials为true

方法：

```vue
Vue.http.options.credentials = true
```

# DRF后端请求报401 Unauthorized和403 Forbidden错误
DRF官方文档:

> SessionAuthentication
> This authentication scheme uses Django's default session backend for authentication. Session authentication is appropriate for AJAX clients that are running in the same session context as your website.

> If successfully authenticated, SessionAuthentication provides the following credentials.

> request.user will be a Django User instance.
request.auth will be None.
Unauthenticated responses that are denied permission will result in an HTTP 403 Forbidden response.

> If you're using an AJAX style API with SessionAuthentication, you'll need to make sure you include a valid CSRF token for any "unsafe" HTTP method calls, such as PUT, PATCH, POST or DELETE requests. See the Django CSRF documentation for more details.

> Warning: Always use Django's standard login view when creating login pages. This will ensure your login views are properly protected.

> CSRF validation in REST framework works slightly differently to standard Django due to the need to support both session and non-session based authentication to the same views. This means that only authenticated requests require CSRF tokens, and anonymous requests may be sent without CSRF tokens. This behaviour is not suitable for login views, which should always have CSRF validation applied.

API中的authentication_classes用来设置验证中间件

API中的permission_classes用来设置API权限

如文档中所说AJAX风格的请求，对于“不安全”的请求，如PUT, PATCH, POST 或 DELETE，需要在请求头中加CSRF token

方法：

```vue
Vue.http.headers.common['X-CSRFToken'] = Vue.cookies.get('csrftoken')
```

或用拦截器实现

```vue
Vue.use(VueCookies)

Vue.http.interceptors.push((request, next) => {
    request.headers.set('X-CSRFToken', Vue.cookies.get('csrftoken'))
    next();
})
```

至于'X-CSRFToken'这个标签名，可以在Django中设置

> The CSRF token cookie is named csrftoken by default, but you can control the cookie name via the CSRF_COOKIE_NAME setting.

> The CSRF header name is HTTP_X_CSRFTOKEN by default, but you can customize it using the CSRF_HEADER_NAME setting.
