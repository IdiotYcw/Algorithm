    You can start multiple workers on the same machine, but be sure to name each individual worker by specifying a node name with the --hostname argument
    
    $ celery -A proj worker --loglevel=INFO --concurrency=10 -n worker1@%h
    $ celery -A proj worker --loglevel=INFO --concurrency=10 -n worker2@%h
    $ celery -A proj worker --loglevel=INFO --concurrency=10 -n worker3@%h
